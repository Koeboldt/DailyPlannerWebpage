To use this website, open the link provided above. At the top of the page the current date is displayed, and a marker of each hour from 9AM to 5PM is displayed alongside their respective boxes. Each box will change color depending on if it is that hour (red), that hour has yet to pass (green), or if that hour has already passed(grey). Each box can be used to write out your schedule throughout the day,  along with a save button that saves the data in that box to local storage. Page checks what hour it is every ten seconds to dynamically update coloration of boxes. 

*Note: currently its only able to save one input, and cannot load the storage until a few bugs are ironed out.
